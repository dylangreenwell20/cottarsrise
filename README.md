# COMP3000 Project - Cottar's Rise
## Description
Cottar's Rise is a medieval-themed rogue-like dungeon crawler game which serves as a submission for my COMP3000 Final Year Project. The game was created in Unity and all scripts are coded with C#.
The game's objective is to reach the end of the dungeon and defeat the boss to progress to a deeper, and more dangerous, dungeon floor.

## Features
This project contains many interesting game mechanics to make each game playthrough unique, such as:
**Procedural Generation** - Each dungeon layout is unique - a total of ten rooms are generated with the first and last room always being the same, but each room in the middle is selected randomly to make each dungeon feel like a new experience.

**Random Spawn Chances** - Each potion, chest and enemy spawn location are random - one dungeon room could be full of loot on the first instance but empty and full of enemies on the next - this variety keeps the player always aware of their surroundings and enhances gameplay.

**Unique Boss Mechanics** - The dungeon boss features three unique attacks - two of which apply effects to the player as well as potentially dealing damage and one can be avoided entirely with correct timing.

**Different Classes** - There are a total of three classes to pick from which each have their own weapons and benefits associated with them. Each class allows for a different gameplay experience.

**Abilities/Perks** - Pick from a list of abilities and random perks to further enhance gameplay and get stronger to help combat more dangerous enemies.
